# Extending k-core: a patterns reference

This is a technical catalog of every mechanism `k-core` offers for extending it — one entry
per mechanism, what it's for, a minimal example, and which real extension under
`k-extensions/` demonstrates it. It's aimed at contributors working in this codebase (human
or agent) who need to answer "what are my options for X" quickly, at whatever depth they
need — skim the table in Section 1 for an overview, or read a full section for detail.

This overlaps on purpose with `../kopling-landing/public/extend.html`, the public-facing
guide for third-party extension authors. That page teaches you how to *write* an extension,
step by step. This file instead catalogs the mechanisms themselves as a reference, with
pointers into `k-core`'s actual source so the "why" behind each one is one click away. If the
two ever disagree, the code is right and both docs are stale.

No prior Laravel/Kopling knowledge is assumed beyond what's explained inline. Jargon (Gate,
Eloquent, service provider, etc.) is explained the first time it's used.

## 1. The big picture

Every extension is one PHP class, `Extension.php`, extending
`Kopling\Core\Extension\AbstractExtension` (`k-core/src/Extension/AbstractExtension.php:17`).
It has no constructor arguments — `Manager` always instantiates it with `new $class()` — and
must implement `name()` and `description()`. Everything else it does is opt-in: implement zero,
one, or many of the *contract interfaces* below, and `Kopling\Core\Extension\Manager`
(`k-core/src/Extension/Manager.php`) discovers what you implemented and wires it into the
running app.

There's a second category that needs no interface at all: **directory conventions**. If your
extension ships a `migrations/`, `views/`, or `lang/` directory, `Manager::conventions()`
(`Manager.php:99`) finds it by its path alone and registers it with Laravel — no class, no
method, just the directory existing.

Quick-reference table — every mechanism, in the order this document covers them:

| Mechanism | Kind | Purpose | Real example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `migrations/`, `views/`, `lang/` dirs | directory convention | database tables, Blade templates, translations | any extension |
| `ExtendsModels` | contract | add relations/casts to a core model | `reactions`, `tags`, `discussions` |
| `HasPermissions` | contract | declare a named, gated capability | `example`, `admin`, `discussions` |
| `ChangesUx` | contract | place UI into a named slot | `example`, `reactions`, `tags` |
| `HasPortals` | contract | register a new page/section | `admin`, core's own `community` |
| `ExtendsPortals` | contract | attach routes/css/js to a page | `example`, `reactions`, `discussions` |
| `ChangesTheme` | contract | ship a colour/radius theme | `theme-delft`, `theme-midnight` |
| `RequestsStorageDriver` | contract | declare a file-storage need | `example` (illustrative only) |
| `HasCommands` | contract | register an artisan command | `reactions`, `tags`, `discussions` |
| `ListensToEvents` | contract | react to a core event | `auth-email-password` |
| `HasLoadOrder` | contract | pin your own load order relative to named packages | `example` (illustrative only) |
| `InfluencesLoadOrder` | contract | require load order for anything implementing a contract you own | none shipped yet |
| `CannotBeDisabled` | marker contract | refuse a future "disable this extension" toggle | `Core`, `admin` |

## 2. Directory conventions (no code required)

If these directories exist at your extension's root, `Manager::conventions()` finds and
registers them automatically — nothing to implement:

- `migrations/` — plain Laravel migration files, loaded via `loadMigrationsFrom()`.
- `views/` — Blade templates, loaded via `loadViewsFrom()` under your extension's own
  namespace (see Section 8 on naming) — reference them as `your-id::some.view`.
- `lang/` — translation files, loaded via `loadTranslationsFrom()`, same namespace —
  reference strings as `__('your-id::file.key')`.

Routes, CSS, and JS are deliberately **not** on this list — see `ExtendsPortals` (Section 6):
attaching them always needs a target Portal (which route group, which page's `<head>`), so a
bare "the directory exists" rule can't express that the way it can for
migrations/views/lang.

## 3. Model extensions — `ExtendsModels`

Lets your extension add an Eloquent relation (Laravel's term for a method like `hasMany()` /
`belongsTo()` that returns related rows) or a cast (how a raw database column value is
turned into a PHP type) onto a **core** model — like `Moment` — without ever touching core's
own model class.

```php
use Kopling\Core\Extend\Model;
use Kopling\Core\Extend\Relation;
use Kopling\Core\Extension\Contract\ExtendsModels;

public function models(): array
{
    return [
        (new Model(Moment::class))
            ->relation((new Relation)->hasMany('reactions', Reaction::class)->eagerLoad()),
    ];
}
```

`->eagerLoad()` marks the relation to be batch-loaded up front for every `Moment` in a feed,
instead of firing one query per card when it's read — the difference between one query and
one-per-row on a page with many cards. It accepts `true`, `false`, or a callable if the
decision depends on the current portal/request/actor.

Two extensions can both add relations to the same model; they combine. A relation-name clash
is last-registered-wins; core's own casts always win over an extension's.

See it in: `k-extensions/reactions/src/Extension.php:48`, `k-extensions/tags/src/Extension.php:63`.

## 4. Permissions — `HasPermissions`

A named, gated capability — never a hardcoded "is this person an admin" check. You write just
the local id (e.g. `"manage-things"`); `Manager` prefixes it to
`"your-extension-id::manage-things"` before it's registered, so you never have to worry about
colliding with another extension's permission of the same name (see Section 8).

```php
use Kopling\Core\Authorization\Permission;
use Kopling\Core\Extension\Contract\HasPermissions;

public function permissions(): array
{
    return [
        new Permission(
            id: 'manage-things',
            label: __('kopling-example::permissions.manage-things.label'),
            description: __('kopling-example::permissions.manage-things.description'),
        ),
    ];
}
```

Under the hood this becomes a Laravel [Gate](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#gates) —
a named check you can later ask "can this person do X?" via `Gate::allows('your-id::manage-things')`
or the `@can` Blade directive. The base check is "does this person hold the permission via one
of their groups"; `Permission::$callback` is an optional *extra* condition layered on top
(e.g. "and they must own this specific record") — it can add a restriction, never grant access
on its own. `Permission::$default` sets the fallback when no group grants it either way.

See it in: `k-extensions/example/src/Extension.php:69`, `k-extensions/discussions/src/Extension.php:61`
(shows `default: true`).

## 5. UI placement — `ChangesUx`

The most-used mechanism: one contract for putting a piece of UI into *any* named slot —
today, the side navigation and a Moment card's body/footer; more surfaces (head assets, admin
widgets) later. There's one contract for all of them, not a separate one per slot.

```php
use Kopling\Core\Extend\Ux;
use Kopling\Core\Extension\Contract\ChangesUx;
use Kopling\Core\Ux\Portal\Navigation\Item;

public function ux(): Ux
{
    return Ux::make()
        ->add(Item::class, ['label' => 'Hello', 'route' => 'kopling-core::community/example.hello'])
        ->in('kopling-core::side-navigation')
        ->as('hello')
        ->when('manage-things');
}
```

Reading the chain:

- `add($component, $data = [])` — registers a Blade component. `$component` is either a class
  name (resolved to its component tag automatically) or an already-valid tag string like
  `"kopling-example::rail"`. `$data` is static config passed to it as a single `data` prop.
- `->in($slot)` — which slot this renders into. Slot names are fully-qualified strings you
  write out in full (e.g. `"kopling-core::card.footer"`) since they're a shared name other
  extensions reference too — never auto-prefixed.
- `->as($id)` — gives this entry a stable name other extensions can anchor to. Defaults to the
  component name if omitted.
- `->after($id)` / `->before($id)` — position relative to another entry in the same slot, by
  its fully-qualified id. Pointing at an entry that doesn't exist (extension not installed, or
  removed) is silently ignored — never an error. This is what lets extensions compose without
  knowing whether each other is installed.
- `->when($condition)` — show only if a permission id (a string, prefixed the same way
  `Permission::$id` is) or a closure `fn(?Person $person): bool` passes.

Two more operations exist for reaching into *another* extension's registration by its
fully-qualified id:

- `->replace($id, $component, $data)` — swap what an already-registered entry renders, keeping
  its position. A no-op if the target doesn't exist.
- `->remove($id)` — delete an already-registered entry outright. Same no-op-if-missing rule.

Both only affect entries registered by an extension that ran *before* yours (load order,
Section 9) — you can't replace/remove something registered after you.

Components registered anonymously (a tag string, not a class) read the render-time binding via
`$context` — e.g. `$context->subject` for "which Moment is this card about" — rather than
needing props threaded through by hand.

See it in: `k-extensions/example/src/Extension.php:87` (add + when), `k-extensions/tags/src/Extension.php:36`
(before), `k-extensions/discussions/src/Extension.php:40` (after, with a dangling anchor that's
fine if `reactions` isn't installed).

## 6. Pages — `HasPortals` and `ExtendsPortals`

A **Portal** is a named page/section — a route prefix plus the Blade layout its pages render
inside (e.g. Core's own `community` portal, or `admin`'s `admin` portal). It's deliberately
**not** an authorization mechanism by itself — routes registered under a Portal still check
their own permission exactly as they would anywhere else. This split is two contracts, not one,
because "declaring a page exists" and "putting something under it" are different concerns —
notably, the extension that declares a Portal doesn't get to skip declaring its own attachment
either; there's exactly one path for both.

**`HasPortals`** declares a Portal's identity only — no routes, no code:

```php
use Kopling\Core\Extension\Contract\HasPortals;
use Kopling\Core\Portal\Portal;

public function portals(): array
{
    return [
        new Portal(
            id: 'admin',
            label: 'Admin',
            path: 'admin',
            layout: 'kopling-admin::layouts.admin',
            permission: 'access-admin',
        ),
    ];
}
```

**`ExtendsPortals`** is the *only* way anything actually attaches to a Portal — routes, plain
hand-written CSS, plain hand-written JS — targeting any Portal, whether your own or someone
else's:

```php
use Kopling\Core\Extension\Contract\ExtendsPortals;
use Kopling\Core\Portal\PortalExtension;

public function extendsPortals(): array
{
    return [
        new PortalExtension('kopling-core::community')
            ->routes(__DIR__.'/../routes/web.php')
            ->css(__DIR__.'/../css/app.css')
            ->js(__DIR__.'/../js/app.js'),
    ];
}
```

Routes ride the target Portal's own route group, inheriting its URL prefix, route name
prefix, and middleware for free. CSS/JS are plain files (no build step) linked onto the page
via a `<link>`/`<script>` tag whenever the current request resolves to that Portal.

Putting your *own* UI into a Portal you don't own (a link in Admin's side navigation, say) is
`ChangesUx` (Section 5), not this — most extensions place a few things into an existing
Portal and never register one of their own.

See it in: `k-extensions/admin/src/Extension.php:58` (HasPortals), `k-extensions/example/src/Extension.php:103`
and `k-extensions/reactions/src/Extension.php:92` (ExtendsPortals).

## 7. Theming — `ChangesTheme`

Ships a named theme: a set of CSS custom-property overrides layered on top of the compiled
base daisyUI theme. Keys must be one of `Kopling\Core\Ux\Theme\Token`'s cases (an unrecognized
key or a value in the wrong shape throws immediately — an author typo, not something to
degrade around); anything you don't mention keeps the compiled default.

```php
use Kopling\Core\Extension\Contract\ChangesTheme;
use Kopling\Core\Ux\Theme\Token;

public function theme(): array
{
    return [
        Token::ColorPrimary->value => '#2b4a9b',
        Token::RadiusBox->value => '1rem',
    ];
}
```

There's no "pick one active theme among several installed" selection yet — every installed
theme's tokens simply merge together, last-declared wins on overlap.

See it in: `k-extensions/theme-delft/src/Extension.php`, `k-extensions/theme-midnight/src/Extension.php`.

## 8. Storage — `RequestsStorageDriver`

Declares a named file-storage *need* — never a backend (local disk, S3, etc.). The actual
backend is chosen later by whoever's administering the install, mapping your named request to
a configured storage drive.

```php
use Kopling\Core\Extension\Contract\RequestsStorageDriver;
use Kopling\Core\Storage\{StorageAccess, StoragePermission, StorageRetention, StorageRequest};

public function storage(): array
{
    return [
        new StorageRequest(
            id: 'avatars',
            label: 'Avatars',
            description: 'Profile pictures uploaded by members.',
            access: StorageAccess::Public,      // Private | Public | Signed (temporary URL)
            retention: StorageRetention::Persistent, // Cache (purgeable) | Persistent
            permission: StoragePermission::ReadWrite, // ReadOnly | ReadWrite
        ),
    ];
}
```

See it in: `k-extensions/example/src/Extension.php:46` (illustrative — not wired to real
functionality yet).

## 9. Commands — `HasCommands`

Registers one or more [artisan commands](https://laravel.com/docs/artisan) (Laravel's CLI task
system) with the app. Return class-strings, not instances — Kopling instantiates them.

```php
use Kopling\Core\Extension\Contract\HasCommands;

public function commands(): array
{
    return [SeedDemoReactionsCommand::class];
}
```

See it in: `k-extensions/reactions/src/Extension.php:34`, `k-extensions/tags`, `k-extensions/discussions`.

## 10. Events — `ListensToEvents`

Maps a core event class to a listener class (or an event subscriber). Kopling resolves and
calls it through the container — the normal Laravel way, just declared here instead of a
service provider.

```php
use Kopling\Core\Extension\Contract\ListensToEvents;

public function listen(): array
{
    return [
        AttemptLogin::class => AttemptPasswordLogin::class,
    ];
}
```

See it in: `k-extensions/auth-email-password/src/Extension.php`.

## 11. Load order — `HasLoadOrder` and `InfluencesLoadOrder`

By default, extensions load in alphabetical-by-package order (deterministic, but otherwise
meaningless). Two ways to change that when order actually matters — e.g. you need another
extension's Portal to already be registered before you attach to it:

**`HasLoadOrder`** — self-declared, by package name. The explicit escape hatch: always wins
over anything `InfluencesLoadOrder` infers for the same pair.

```php
use Kopling\Core\Extension\LoadOrder\HasLoadOrder;

public function loadAfter(): array  { return ['kopling/admin']; }
public function loadBefore(): array { return []; }
```

A reference to a package that isn't installed is ignored, never an error.

**`InfluencesLoadOrder`** — the inverse direction: if you *own* a contract (say a future
`HasSettings` interface belonging to `kopling/admin`), you can require every extension that
*implements* it to load after/before you, without ever knowing which packages will implement
it.

```php
use Kopling\Core\Extension\LoadOrder\{Directive, InfluencesLoadOrder};

public function loadOrderRules(): array
{
    return [HasSettings::class => Directive::After];
}
```

See it in: `k-extensions/example/src/Extension.php:129` (`HasLoadOrder`, illustrative).
`InfluencesLoadOrder` has no shipped implementor yet — `kopling/admin` is the intended first,
once a `HasSettings`-style contract exists worth requiring order against.

## 12. `CannotBeDisabled` (marker contract)

No methods — just a flag. No admin-facing "disable this extension" toggle exists yet, but
whenever one is built, it must refuse for anything implementing this. Covers both Core itself
(not a real "disableable" extension) and a hosting provider bundling an extension they don't
want an admin able to turn off.

```php
use Kopling\Core\Extension\Contract\CannotBeDisabled;

class Extension extends AbstractExtension implements CannotBeDisabled { /* ... */ }
```

See it in: `Kopling\Core\Core` (`k-core/src/Core.php:31`), `k-extensions/admin/src/Extension.php:29`.

## 13. Naming and collision safety

One rule threads through almost every mechanism above: you write a **local** id
(`"manage-things"`, `"rail"`, `"admin"`), and `Manager::id($package)`
(`Manager.php:135`) prefixes it with your extension's own id — its Composer package name with
`/` replaced by `-` (e.g. `kopling/example` → `kopling-example`) — before it's ever registered.
This applies to permission ids, Portal ids, UxEntry ids/conditions, and storage request ids.
The result: two extensions can both declare a permission called `"manage-things"` and never
collide, because they end up as `kopling-example::manage-things` and
`acme-other::manage-things`.

References that point at *someone else's* fully-qualified id — `Ux::after()`/`before()`,
`Ux::replace()`/`remove()`'s target, `PortalExtension`'s target Portal, `HasLoadOrder`'s
package names — are written out in full by the author and never auto-prefixed, since they're
foreign references, not something you own the naming of. Every one of these degrades
gracefully: pointing at something that doesn't exist (extension not installed, typo, removed)
is a silent no-op, never an error. This is deliberate — it's what lets extensions compose
without needing to know whether each other is installed.

## 14. How it's actually wired up (for the curious)

You don't need this to write an extension, but it explains where the above actually runs:

1. `Manifest` (`k-core/src/Extension/Manifest.php`) reads Composer's `installed.json` at boot,
   filters for packages declaring `"type": "kopling-extension"`, and caches the result.
2. `Manager::extensions()` instantiates each one (`new $class()`), always with `Core` pinned
   first, then orders them via `LoadOrder\Resolver` (Section 9's mechanism, Kahn's algorithm
   under the hood).
3. `Provider\ServiceProvider::boot()` (`k-core/src/Provider/ServiceProvider.php:46`) — a
   Laravel [service provider](https://laravel.com/docs/providers) (the standard place Laravel
   packages register themselves with the framework) — runs once per request-cycle boot: it
   registers directory conventions, defines every permission as a Gate, and calls
   `$manager->listeners()` / `$manager->models()` for their side effects.
   `Manager::ux()` / `portals()` / `portalExtensions()` etc. are read later, on demand, by
   whatever's rendering (a Blade view, a route).
